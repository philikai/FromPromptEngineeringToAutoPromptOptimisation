    "# Automatic Prompt Optimization for Marketing Template Generation with minimal framework usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to explore the option of running auto prompt optimization without relying heavily on frameworks, or with minimal framework usage such as Langchain. The primary function of Langchain we will utilize is its provision of prompt templates. Apart from that, we will endeavor to write the code independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware that this code is specifically tuned for generating prompt templates that will later be filled with user data. As we progress, it will become evident that crafting such a notebook on our own can be highly educational. However, it's important to acknowledge the significant role frameworks play. They are specifically designed to orchestrate prompt and Large Language Model (LLM) flows, and their assistance can be invaluable.\n",

    "### User Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to play the role of a marketing analyst, who is given the task of promoting an Unsecured Installment Loan to prospective customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before this application, you used to manually create email templates for the marketing campaign. With this application, you will generate hyperpersonalized marketing emails for each of your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look a the application front end that has been deployed:\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to automate the tedious part of running from 1..N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary objective is to automate the process of prompt optimization, enabling the generation of marketing content that is not only engaging but also tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the audience. By applying advanced techniques in prompt engineering and optimization, we aim to enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, reducing the time and effort required for content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we want to build\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/optimisation_loop.png\" style=\"width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we embark on a journey to leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for optimizing marketing communication prompts. The goal is to generate highly effective and engaging marketing content that resonates with the target audience, ensuring higher conversion rates and better customer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup and Configuration**: Setting up the necessary libraries, tools, and configurations required to run the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation and AutoPrompter Class**: Loading and preparing the marketing data, including product information and customer profiles, to be used in the optimization process. We also define the AutoPrompter class to handle the calls to Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial Prompt Design**: Crafting an initial prompt that will serve as the starting point for the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimization Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Execution**: Running the initial prompt through the LLM to generate marketing content.\n",
    "   - **Evaluation**: Assessing the effectiveness of the generated content against predefined metrics or objectives.\n",
    "   - **Improvement**: Adjusting the prompt based on the evaluation results to enhance the quality of the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration**: Repeating the optimization loop with the improved prompt, refining the process until the desired level of content effectiveness is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Analysis and Results**: Analyzing the optimized prompts and the corresponding generated content, highlighting the improvements and the impact on marketing objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings, the benefits of automatic prompt optimization, and potential future directions for leveraging AI in marketing content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a refined, optimized prompt that can be used to generate marketing content that is not only engaging but also aligned with the strategic goals of the marketing campaign.\n"

    "In this section, we leverage a comprehensive dataset of financial products to enhance the personalization and relevance of our marketing content. The `products_data` dictionary contains detailed information about various financial products offered by the bank, including loans and credit cards. Each product entry is meticulously detailed with attributes like name, description, key features, benefits, and suitability for different customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of `products_data`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `products_data` dictionary is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `products`: An array of product objects, where each object contains:\n",
    "  - `id`: A unique identifier for the product.\n",
    "  - `Name`: The name of the product.\n",
    "  - `Title`: A short title that highlights the product's purpose or key advantage.\n",
    "  - `Description`: A detailed description of the product, explaining its nature and how it can be beneficial to the customer.\n",
    "  - `Key Features`: A list of the product's most significant features, which are crucial for the customer's decision-making process.\n",
    "  - `Key Benefits`: A list of benefits that the customer can expect from using the product.\n",
    "  - `Great For`: Suggestions on what the product is particularly well-suited for, helping to target the content more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this structured product data, our objectives in this section are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Relevant Product Information**: Identify and extract key information from the `products_data` that is relevant to the target customer's profile and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Personalize Marketing Content**: Utilize the extracted product information to tailor the marketing content, making it more relevant and appealing to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: By providing personalized and detailed information about the products that best match the customer's financial goals and needs, we aim to improve customer engagement and conversion rates.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will iterate over the `products_data`, and for each product, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Match the product to the customer's profile and financial needs based on the `user_variables` and `sender_variables`.\n",
    "2. Generate personalized marketing content using the product's details, focusing on how the product can address the customer's specific financial goals and challenges.\n",
    "3. Optimize the content through iterative evaluation and improvement, ensuring it is engaging, factual, and in line with the bank's reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that our marketing content is not only personalized but also grounded in the actual financial products and services offered by the bank, thereby enhancing its relevance and impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User and Sender Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `user_variables`: This dictionary contains detailed information about the customer, including personal details, financial information, and specific interests. These variables are crucial for personalizing the marketing content and making it resonate with the customer's unique circumstances and goals.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section of the notebook, we focus on the practical application of automatic prompt optimization for creating personalized marketing content. We leverage a set of user and sender variables to tailor the content towards the specific needs and preferences of individual customers. The aim is to enhance the effectiveness of marketing communication by making it more relevant and engaging to the recipient.\n",
