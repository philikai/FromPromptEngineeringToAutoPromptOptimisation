Human:You are a prompt optimizer and your task is to evaluate if the models stays within certain guardrails that we have set.
You have 2 tasks. 
Task 1 is to evaluate a large language model output against those guardrails and score them on how well they satisfy the prompt template between the <prompt_template></prompt_template> tags. 
Do not rate how well it adheres to the output format.
Be extremely strict and rate the model output, that is marked between the <model_output></model_output> tags on a scale from 1 - 100 and output the score between the <score></score> tags.
Note that it is very hard to reach more than 90 points on this task. 
Task 2 is to give improvement recommendation on the prompt template.
Output your recommendations between <recommendation></recommendation> tags. 

The prompt template has variables as placeholders and you can't add new variables or change the ones that are there. The variables are denoted with curly brackets.
The filled  prompt template is between the <filled_prompt></filled_prompt> tag and has the variables substituted with the values. Only focus on the non-filled prompt template.

- The model must stay factually correct.
- The banks reputation is of highest priority. We can not tolerate any made up stories.

Overall the prompt template looks good, but here are a couple suggestions for improvement:

- Be more specific about the type of marketing content wanted (e.g. email, social media post, etc). This will help the model generate more tailored content. 

- Consider adding some high-level guidance around tone and voice - for example, that content should be professional yet friendly and aimed at building trust with the customer.

- Add a bit more context about the customer's financial situation or goals if possible, as this will help the model craft more personalized content.

- Specify if there are any compliance requirements or legal disclaimers that must be included in the marketing content.

- Provide some example outlines or templates that show the expected structure and sections for the content. This will help guide the model.

- Include any branding guidelines or specifics around use of bank name, slogans, etc. that should be followed.

Overall the template covers the key elements, but adding some additional context, guidelines and examples could help improve quality.

Dear Josh Milwakee,

My name is John Smith from First National Bank. I hope this email finds you well. 

I wanted to let you know about our Unsecured Installment Loan product that can help you reach your financial goals in a responsible way. 

With an Unsecured Installment Loan from FNB, you can borrow anywhere from $2,500 to $25,000 in a lump sum. This can be useful for larger purchases, home renovations, new appliances, debt consolidation, and more.

The loan has a fixed interest rate and fixed repayment schedule so you know exactly what to expect each month. We also offer an interest rate discount when you set up automatic payments from an FNB deposit account. 

Repayment terms are flexible, ranging from 12 to 60 months. This allows you to choose a monthly payment that fits within your budget.

I know how important trust is when it comes to financial institutions. Our customers count on FNB for transparent, factual information. We take great pride in our reputation and are committed to informing and assisting you. 

Please let me know if you would like to learn more about how an Unsecured Installment Loan can help you meet your goals. I would be happy to discuss the details and options with no obligation on your part.

To further improve adherence to the prompt template requirements, I would recommend:

- Adding a variable like {regulatory_text} that the model can use to explicitly state compliance with regulations and include any mandatory disclaimers. 

- Moving the interest rate discount to the {product_key_features} variable so it is highlighted upfront as a main benefit.

- Adding a variable like {sender_info} that provides details on the sender's name, position, and contact information to personalize the outreach.

- Providing an example friendly tone and language in the prompt instructions that models the desired communication style.

This will help guide the model to cover compliance, emphasize key features, personalize the message, and maintain an appropriate tone. The improved prompt structure should result in outputs that better satisfy the template requirements.

Human:You are a prompt optimizer and your task is to evaluate if the models stays within certain guardrails that we have set.
You have 2 tasks. 
Task 1 is to evaluate a large language model output against those guardrails and score them on how well they satisfy the prompt template between the <prompt_template></prompt_template> tags. 
Do not rate how well it adheres to the output format.
Be extremely strict and rate the model output, that is marked between the <model_output></model_output> tags on a scale from 1 - 100 and output the score between the <score></score> tags.
Note that it is very hard to reach more than 90 points on this task. 
Task 2 is to give improvement recommendation on the prompt template.
Output your recommendations between <recommendation></recommendation> tags. 

The prompt template has variables as placeholders and you can't add new variables or change the ones that are there. The variables are denoted with curly brackets.
The filled  prompt template is between the <filled_prompt></filled_prompt> tag and has the variables substituted with the values. Only focus on the non-filled prompt template.

<guadrails>
- The model must stay factually correct.
- The banks reputation is of highest priority. We can not tolerate any made up stories.
- The content must be personalized, but you can only use the variables that are given to you.
- If the model is not staying factually correct, the score can maximum be 50.
- The template must be a prompt template to the model, not the final email.
</guardrails>

The non-filled prompt template with variables as placeholders:
<prompt_template>{non_filled_prompt}</prompt_template>

This the final prompt:
<final_prompt>{filled_prompt}</final_prompt>

The model output:
<model_output>{content}</model_output>

Assistant:"|"

Human:You are a prompt optimizer and your task is to improve large language model outputs via a technique called prompt engineering.
You are tasked to improve the prompt, by adjusting the prompt template between the <INST></INST> tags and you are creating the prompt template, not the email itself! 
In the history, you will get information about how good the prompt is via the score between the <score></score> tags, when the model is run on the prompt template and stays between 0 and 100 (100 being the best score). 

The history of the last prompts and scores is between the <prompt_history></prompt_history> tags.
<prompt_history>{history}</prompt_history>

The following recommendations have been made to improve the current prompt template:
<recommendation>{recommendation}</recommendation>

The current prompt template is:
<current_prompt><INST>{non_filled_prompt}</INST></current_prompt>

The guardrails are:
<guadrails>
- The model must stay factually correct.
- The banks reputation is of highest priority. We can not tolerate any made up stories.
- If the model is not staying factually correct, the score can maximum be 25.
</guardrails>

Create <new_prompt_template></new_prompt_template> tags and only adjust the prompt template between the <INST></INST> tags.
Make sure that you adhere to the guardrails. Furthermore, you only have access to the user and product variables denoted between the <variables></variables> tags, do not invent more variables!<variables>
<product_variables>""product_name"",""product_description"", ""product_key_features"",""product_great_for""</product_variables> 
<user_variables>['first_name_RECIPIENT', 'last_name_RECIPIENT', 'age_RECIPIENT', 'channel', 'lang', 'product_id', 'account_status', 'customer_since', 'monthly_income', 'monthly_expense_average', 'savings_account_balance', 'retirement_fund_balance', 'investment_portfolio', 'credit_score', 'home_ownership', 'preferred_contact_time', 'financial_goals', 'online_banking_usage', 'relationship_manager', 'notes']</user_variables>
</variables>

User: 
ALWAYS remember, that you can only chose from the variables shown above. When calling a variable, you need to put it in curly braces!
Think step-by-step.

"|"
Overall the prompt template looks good, but here are a couple suggestions for improvement:

- Be more specific about the required tone. For example, you could give examples of friendly, helpful phrases to use like ""I wanted to let you know about..."" or ""This option may be helpful for you because..."". Giving the model exact words/phrases to include can help guide it.

- Consider adding more details about compliance requirements. For example, you could specify that a disclaimer is needed at the end stating ""Subject to credit approval"" or similar legal language. 

- Add instructions to close the message in a friendly way, like ""Please let me know if you have any other questions!"" or ""I look forward to hearing from you!"". This helps ensure the tone stays warm and not too sales-y.

- Specify the ideal length, like ""The message should be 1-2 paragraphs long"" so the model doesn't write excessively long content.

Overall the template covers the key points well. Just a bit more specificity around tone, compliance, closing, and length could help improve the results.
